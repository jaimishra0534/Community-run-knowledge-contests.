## **Description**  
The **Community-Run Knowledge Contests** smart contract is a decentralized platform that enables users to create and participate in knowledge-based contests. Contest organizers can set up competitions with an initial reward pool, and participants can contribute to increase the prize fund. This contract promotes collaborative learning and incentivizes intellectual engagement within the community.  

## **Vision of the Project**  
The goal of this project is to establish a **trustless, transparent, and decentralized** system for knowledge-based competitions. By leveraging blockchain technology, we aim to:
- Provide an **accessible** platform for knowledge-sharing.  
- Encourage **fair and transparent** reward distribution.  
- Create a **global** network for collaborative learning and competition.  

## **Future Scope**  
While the current contract allows contest creation and participation, future enhancements may include:  
- **Automated Winner Selection:** Implementing logic to determine contest winners based on predefined criteria.  
- **Multi-Stage Contests:** Supporting multiple rounds with different levels of difficulty.  
- **Reputation System:** Introducing user credibility scores based on past contest performance.  
- **Decentralized Governance:** Allowing the community to propose and vote on contest rules.  
- **NFT-Based Rewards:** Issuing NFTs as achievement badges for top participants.
